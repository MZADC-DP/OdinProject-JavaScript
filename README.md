Lesson Overview
This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

    1. Name the eight data types in JavaScript.
        String
        Number
        Bigint
        Boolean
        Undefined
        Null
        Symbol
        Object

    2. Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.

        Single quote box (''): This box is the simplest one. You can put any words you want inside it, like "hello" or "apple".

        Double quote box (""): This box is just like the single quote box, but it looks a little different. You can put words inside it too, like "world" or "banana".

        Backtick box (``): This box is special. It can do more things! You can put lots of words inside it, and even make them go on different lines. It's like having a big box to hold a long story. The backtick box also lets you do a trick called "interpolation." It means you can put something inside the box that will change. For example, if you have a box with the word "My name is ${name}", and you put your name in there, it will say "My name is [your name]". It's like a box that can talk and fill in the missing parts!

        Embed a variable/expression in a string.
        let name = "Angelo";
        let greeting = 'My name is ${name}';


    3. Understand what a method is.
        A method is a preset defined list of instructions that a certain object already knows what to do with. example objects of type string have toUpperCase() method.


    4. Name the three logical operators.
        && 
        ||
        !

    5. Understand what the comparison operators are.
        ==
        !=
        ===
        !==


    6. Understand what conditionals are.
        If else statements. If this happens do that, else do something else

    7. Understand what nesting is.
        Having something inside that something.
        You have 1 for loop, and within that for loop, you have another for loop.


    8. Understand what truthy and falsy values are.

        Falsy values are those that are "empty" or "not valuable" such as 
        false
        0
        ""
        null
        undefined
        NaN

        Truthy is all those that are not Falsy
