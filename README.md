Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.

    Single quote box (''): This box is the simplest one. You can put any words you want inside it, like "hello" or "apple".

    Double quote box (""): This box is just like the single quote box, but it looks a little different. You can put words inside it too, like "world" or "banana".

    Backtick box (``): This box is special. It can do more things! You can put lots of words inside it, and even make them go on different lines. It's like having a big box to hold a long story. The backtick box also lets you do a trick called "interpolation." It means you can put something inside the box that will change. For example, if you have a box with the word "My name is ${name}", and you put your name in there, it will say "My name is [your name]". It's like a box that can talk and fill in the missing parts!

    let greeting = 'My name is ${name}';
